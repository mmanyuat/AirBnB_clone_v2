irBnB Clone - Web Flask

This project uses Flask to create web routes for the AirBnB clone application. 
It includes a basic setup with a single route (`/`) that displays "Hello HBNB!" 
and instructions to run the application. To get started, 
clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install Flask, 
and run the script using `python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route`.
